# IBM MQ JMS Spring Components

This repository contains code to help to provide Spring developers with easy configuration of the IBM MQ JMS package.

The library contains:
* `mq-jms-spring-boot-starter` for [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) applications

## HEALTH WARNINGS
This initial release has had limited testing.  

The compiled code has not yet been replicated to Maven Central. Once that has happened, it will be available
under the 'com.ibm.mq' GroupId. You will have to use your build systems to compile this package as a local dependency for now.   

## Installation and Usage
If the VERSION file contains "LOCAL" in the version definition, then the gradle build process puts the 
generated jar into your local directory tree. It can then be referenced from the application build. 

### Spring Boot Applications


Gradle:
```
repositories {
   mavenLocal()
   mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile group: 'com.ibm.mq', name: 'mq-jms-spring-boot-starter', version: '0.0.1'
}
```

Maven:
~~~ xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.ibm.mq</groupId>
  <artifactId>mq-jms-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
~~~

## Design Approach
The approach taken here is to follow the model for JMS applications shown in the 
[Spring Getting Started Guide for JMS](https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-jms/). That in turn is based on using the [JmsTemplate Framework](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.3.13.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#jms) 

The same application code from that example ought to work with MQ, with the simple replacement of the messaging provider in its dependency to point at this package, and changing the queue name ("mailbox" in that example) to "DEV.QUEUE.1",
which is created automatically in the Docker-packaged MQ server.

Essentially what gets configured from this package is a ConnectionFactory which Spring's JmsTemplate implementation
exploits to provide a simpler interface. 

## Getting Started

To get started quickly, you can use the default configuration settings in this package along with the
IBM MQ for Developers container which runs the server processes.

### Default Configuration
The default options have been selected to match the 
[MQ Docker container](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-docker) development configuration.  

This means that you can run a queue manager using that Docker environment and connect to it. This script
will run the container on a Linux system.

~~~
docker run --env LICENSE=accept --env MQ_QMGR_NAME=QM1 \ 
           --publish 1414:1414 \
           --publish 9443:9443 \ 
           --detach \
           ibmcom/mq 
~~~

The default attributes are

~~~
mq.queueManager=QM1
mq.channel=DEV.ADMIN.SVRCONN
mq.connName=localhost(1414)
mq.user=admin
mq.password=passw0rd
~~~

### Extended Configuration Options
If you already have a running MQ queue manager that you want to use, then you can easily modify the 
default configuration to match by providing override values.  

The queue manager name is given as 
* `mq.queueManager`

For client connections to a queue manager, you must also set
* `mq.channel` 
* `mq.connName`
If both the channel and connName are not supplied, then a local queue manager is assumed. 

You will probably also need to set
* `mq.user`
* `mq.password`
to override the default values. These attributes can be set to an empty value, to use the local OS userid 
automatically with no authentication (if the queue manager has been set up to allow that). 

For example in an `application.properties` file:

~~~
mq.queueManager=QM1
mq.channel=SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN
mq.connName=server.example.com(1414)
mq.user=user1
mq.password=passw0rd
~~~

Spring Boot will then create a ConnectionFactory that can then be used to interact with your queue manager.
