## HEALTH WARNINGS
This initial release is really a skeleton placeholder. It has not even been tested yet!

The compiled code has not yet been replicated to Maven Central. Once that has happened, it will be available
under the 'com.ibm.mq' GroupId. So the instructions below will not actually work for automatic installation of
the jar. You will have to use your build systems to compile this package as a local dependency for now.   

## Installation and Usage

### Spring Boot Applications

Gradle:
```groovy
dependencies {
    compile group: 'com.ibm.mq', name: 'mq-jms-spring-boot-starter', version: '0.0.1'
}
```

Maven:
~~~ xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.ibm.mq</groupId>
  <artifactId>mq-jms-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
~~~

## Design Approach
The approach taken here is to follow the model for JMS applications shown in the [Spring Getting Started Guide for JMS]
(https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-jms/). That in turn is based on using the [JmsTemplate Framework](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.3.13.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#jms) 

The same application code from that example ought to work with MQ, with the simple replacement of the messaging provider in its dependency to point at this package.  

Essentially what gets configured from this package is a ConnectionFactory which the JmsTemplate implementation exploits
to provide a simpler interface. 

## Getting Started

This section will contains simple examples of connecting to an MQ queue manager using the library.

### Spring Boot Applications

You need to already have a running MQ queue manager, and you must provide the queue manager name as a property:

* `mq.queueManager`

For client connections to a queue manager, you must also set
* `mq.channel` 
* `mq.connName`

If both the channel and connName are not supplied, then a local queue manager is assumed. You can also set
* `mq.user`
* `mq.password`

For example in an `application.properties` file:

~~~
mq.queueManager=QM1
mq.channel=SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN
mq.connName=server.example.com(1414)
mq.user=user1
mq.password=passw0rd
~~~

Spring Boot will create a ConnectionFactory that can then be used to interact with your queue manager.
